          <div className='titleHeading2'>III/ What are the differences between body wave and loose wave</div>
          <div className='detailHeading2'>
            <div className='detailContent2'>Even with semi-permanent hair extensions that are claimed to be safe to sleep with, some things can go wrong. Some people have bad sleeping habits. They roll over a lot in their sleep and wake up with curly hair. Others share their beds with partners or children, or pets who can unknowingly lay on the hair extensions.

              <div className='titleBlock2'>Ponytails and braids</div>
              <div className='contentBlock2'>The best way to prevent tangling, especially if you are wearing a long hair extension, is to secure it in a braid. Every day before bed, use a detangling-specialized brush to brush your hair gently and then make a loose braid. It can keep your hair neat and prevent tangling caused by your partner or yourself. Braiding your hair extension before sleeping can help form natural wavy hair in the morning. You can customize the volume by weaving it tighter or looser. 
If you have a medium or short hair extension, tie it with a band or make a simple ponytail to keep it out of the way while sleeping. Remember always to brush your hair beforehand to remove any knots and tangles. Do not tie your hair too tight it can cause tension and discomfort.

              <div className='titleBlock2'>Hair cap and scarf</div>
              <div className='contentBlock2'>An easier way to protect your hair extension is to put it in a hair cap made for sleeping. A sleeping hair cap is often made of satin or silk – a fabric with a smooth, wrinkle-free texture that will help limit tangles during sleep. Tie your hair or braid it if you want to, and put the cap on top. 
Use a silk scarf to wrap your hair if you do not want curly hair when you wake up because of the braids. No matter if you choose a hair cap or a scarf, it is best not to use one that is made of cotton since cotton absorbs your hair’s moisture and makes it dry and frizzy.
