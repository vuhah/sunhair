              Hair loss or thinning hair can be caused by a variety of
              culprits—including nutrition deficiencies. So while vitamins and
              supplements are not a miracle cure by any means, the right ones
              just might make a difference in the way your hair looks and feels.
              <br />
              Here’s a look at the best vitamins for hair growth, and a few
              supplements experts recommend. <br />
              <div className="titleHeading1 mt-5 mb-5">
                What Types of Vitamins Help With Hair Growth?
              </div>
              Hair growth and healthiness are influenced by a number of factors,
              including nutrition, genetics, medical conditions, hormones and
              even stress. Research finds that a deficiency in vitamins and
              minerals important for normal cell growth and function may
              contribute to hair loss.
              <br />
              “Vitamins are essential for healthy hair growth and may help in
              preventing hair shedding and thinning,” says Michele Green, M.D.,
              a cosmetic dermatologist in New York. “The best vitamins for hair
              growth include B vitamins, vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, biotin and
              iron.
            </div>
            <div className="blockContent1">
              <div className="titleBlock1">Vitamin B</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Complex B vitamins play a role in hair growth, and are
                “essential for metabolism and nervous system function,” says Dr.
                Green. “It is no wonder that B vitamins like vitamin B7 (biotin)
                and B12 are important to strengthen and condition the hair.”
                <br />
                Research shows you can easily reach the daily allowances of B
                vitamins by eating a balanced diet. B vitamins can be found in a
                variety of foods, including 100% whole grains, meat, fish, whole
                eggs, nuts and avocados.
              </div>
              <div className="titleBlock1">Biotin</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, is a complex B vitamin that is
                often touted for having hair growth benefits. And some of that
                hype may actually be worth it. Biotin has functions in “creating
                red blood cells, which carry oxygen and nutrients to the scalp
                and hair follicles,” says Dr. Green. It also “plays a role in
                keratin production, which is a main component of hair.”
                <br />
                Most people receive enough biotin from the foods they eat, notes
                the National Institutes of Health. The best way to get more is
                to eat biotin-rich foods. Dr. Green recommends milk, eggs,
                bananas, salmon, sweet potatoes and almonds. If you do feel you
                need an extra boost, talk to your doctor—supplement labels
                reveal that many biotin supplements for hair, skin and nails far
                exceed the recommended daily amount.
              </div>
              <div className="titleBlock1">Vitamin C</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Vitamin C isn’t only good for maintaining immunity, it may also
                make hair stronger. Dr. Green notes that as a powerful
                antioxidant, vitamin C is essential for healthy hair growth.
                “Vitamin C helps increase blood circulation throughout your
                body, including your scalp,” she says. “When there is increased
                blood circulation to your scalp, there is greater stimulation of
                your hair follicles, which may help promote hair growth.”
              </div>
              <div className="titleBlock1">Iron</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Iron plays a surprisingly important role in hair growth, too,
                and research in the Journal of Korean Medical Science suggests a
                link between iron deficiencies and hair loss among women[2].
                This micronutrient boosts circulation and helps move oxygen to
                your cells more efficiently, explains Dr. Green, which may aid
                in hair growth. “If you do not get enough iron, your body cannot
                produce sufficient hemoglobin, which will falter oxygen delivery
                to your scalp and contribute to hair loss,” she says.
                <br />
                She recommends eating foods high in iron, such as clams, red
                meat, spinach and lentils. An iron supplement may also be worth
                adding to your routine if you are at risk of iron deficiency,
                but check with your doctor first.
              </div>

              <div className="titleBlock1">Keratin</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Keratin is a protein that makes up our hair, skin and nails,
                notes Dr. Green. It’s naturally produced by the body, and there
                are many keratin supplements out there that claim to help with
                hair growth. However, Dr. Green suggests “supplementing” with
                keratin in a more natural way—by eating protein-rich foods like
                eggs, beans, fish and meats—rather than taking a pill. “There
                are no reliable studies that show keratin helps with hair
                growth,” she says. “Additionally, over-supplementing keratin can
                be harmful due to excess protein buildup in the body.”
              </div>

              <div className="titleBlock1">Vitamin D</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                A deficiency in vitamin D may result in hair loss, according to
                Dr. Green. “Vitamin D is metabolized in the skin by
                keratinocytes, skin cells that produce keratin,” she says. “When
                the body does not have enough vitamin D, the keratinocytes in
                hair follicles have trouble facilitating hair growth, resulting
                in shedding and hair loss.”
                <br />
                Zinc is a trace mineral and only needed by the body in small
                amounts. It’s small but mighty, and plays a role in everything
                from the growth of cells to creating DNA. “Low levels of zinc
                have been associated with hair loss and poor wound healing,”
                says Dr. Green. She recommends eating zinc-rich foods, like
                meat, beans, nuts and seeds.
                <br />
                If you struggle with hair loss or hair thinning, it also might
                be worth talking to your doctor about whether a zinc supplement
                could be right for you. One small study found that zinc
                supplementation should be given to alopecia patients who have a
                low serum zinc level[3].

              <div className="titleBlock1">Vitamin A</div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Vitamin A might help with hair growth, but there’s a catch:
                taking too much of it might actually result in hair loss.Vitamin
                A refers to a group of compounds that include retinol, retinal,
                retinoic acid and provitamin A carotenoids, explains Dr. Green.
                “There has been a study involving mice that showed dietary
                vitamin A activated hair follicle stem cells,” she says.
                “However, this is complex…on the contrary, there has been
                evidence that high levels of vitamin A through
                over-supplementation is linked to hair loss.”
                <br />
                She notes that while vitamin A deficiency can contribute to hair
                loss, it’s not common in the U.S, adding that unless you have
                proof of a vitamin A deficiency, there’s no reason to
                supplement.
                <br />
                Eating foods rich in vitamin A may be better, she says,
                including leafy greens like kale, spinach and broccoli, orange
                vegetables like carrots, pumpkin and sweet potatoes, and yellow
                vegetables like squash.

                The above vitamins and minerals aren’t the only way to improve
                your hair health; Dr. Green notes that some oils, like rosemary
                and coconut oil, may also help with hair growth. A study found
                that consistent use of rosemary oil over several months led to
                an increase in hair count.
                <br />
                Meanwhile, another study that compared coconut oil to mineral
                oil and sunflower oil found that coconut oil was the only one
                that reduced the protein loss for both undamaged and damaged
                hair when it was used as a pre-wash and post-wash treatment.
