        <h1>How To Sleep Comfortably With Hair Extensions</h1>
        <div className="p1">October 12 - Sun Nguyen</div>
        <div className="detailTitle">
          For many women, hair extensions and wigs have become a lifesaver to
          help refresh their everyday looks quickly. The variety of hair
          extensions has brought more options and, at the same time, transformed
          every woman into an expert in the art of caretaking. However, the
          question of how to sleep with hair extensions always confuses many.
          Should I sleep while wearing my clip-in extension? Is it ok to wrap it
          with a scarf if I move my head a lot when sleeping? It is essential
          that you can both preserve your hair extensions properly and get a
          comfortable sleep. In this article, Anka Hair will give you all the
          information you need about sleeping with hair extensions.{" "}

            Can you sleep with hair extensions?

              First and foremost, you can sleep with hair extensions. Though it
              may sound a bit troublesome, all problems can be solved with
              proper consideration. There are many types of hair extensions and
              wigs; you will have to notice that some are safe to sleep with and
              others are not.{" "}

              </div>
              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Clip-in hair extensions – as it is called – contain several
                clips that are hard and not made for sleeping. The pins can
                cause discomfort or hurt your scalp and get tangled up with the
                hair, and turn it into a complete mess in the morning. You do
                not have to sleep with your clip-in hair extensions since they
                are so easy to remove and reattach. Take your clip-in off before
                bed and attach it again in the morning to preserve your hair
                extensions and get the best sleep.

                What types of extensions are safe to sleep?

              <div className="contentBlock1">
                Except for removable hair extensions such as clip-in or wigs –
                which are recommended to take off before bed, most other hair
                extensions are safe to sleep. For example, keratin hair
                extensions and tape-in hair extensions are semi-permanent
                methods. While keratin hair uses hot or cold fusion techniques
                to attach to the natural hair, tape-in hair extensions use tape.
                The attachment, therefore, is quite solid and hard to break.
                Sleeping or rolling over your bed is completely safe if you
                adhere to them correctly and the bonds are secure.
                <br></br>The same goes for semi-permanent methods such as sew-in
                or weft hair extensions. Since the uninstallation would require
                lots of effort, removing it every day before bed would be
                impossible. You can rest yourself nicely without having to take
                it off.

              Even with semi-permanent hair extensions that are claimed to be
              safe to sleep with, some things can go wrong. Some people have bad
              sleeping habits. They roll over a lot in their sleep and wake up
              with curly hair. Others share their beds with partners or
              children, or pets who can unknowingly lay on the hair extensions.
              These are all external effects you cannot avoid but can be
              minimized.{" "}

                The best way to prevent tangling, especially if you are wearing
                a long hair extension, is to secure it in a braid. Every day
                before bed, use a detangling-specialized brush to brush your
                hair gently and then make a loose braid. It can keep your hair
                neat and prevent tangling caused by your partner or yourself.
                Braiding your hair extension before sleeping can help form
                natural wavy hair in the morning. You can customize the volume
                by weaving it tighter or looser. If you have a medium or short
                hair extension, tie it with a band or make a simple ponytail to
                keep it out of the way while sleeping. Remember always to brush
                your hair beforehand to remove any knots and tangles. Do not tie
                your hair too tight it can cause tension and discomfort.

              <div className="titleBlock2">Hair cap and scarf</div>
              <div className="contentBlock2">
                An easier way to protect your hair extension is to put it in a
                hair cap made for sleeping. A sleeping hair cap is often made of
                satin or silk – a fabric with a smooth, wrinkle-free texture
                that will help limit tangles during sleep. Tie your hair or
                braid it if you want to, and put the cap on top. Use a silk
                scarf to wrap your hair if you do not want curly hair when you
                wake up because of the braids. No matter if you choose a hair
                cap or a scarf, it is best not to use one that is made of cotton
                since cotton absorbs your hair’s moisture and makes it dry and
                frizzy.

                You have just read it: Cotton fabric absorbs moisture and makes
                your hair dry. That’s why you need to pay attention to your
                pillows and pillowcases fabric. Satin or silk pillows are
                essentials for your hair care routine. Sleeping with a satin or
                silk pillow may reduce friction, making the cuticles rough and
                broken.{" "}

              </div>
              <div className="contentBlock3">
                Wet hair tends to get tangled up easier and can become a mess in
                the morning, which takes hours and hours to detangle. So before
                braiding your hair or wrapping it in a scarf, make sure the hair
                is dehydrated. If you can not wait for it to air dry, use a
                blow-dryer at low to medium temperature.{" "}

              <div className="contentBlock3">
                Use a snag-free hair band and tie your hair just enough to keep
                it in place. If you connect your hair or braid it too tight, it
                can cause tension and damage to your scalp and a discomfortable
                feeling.{" "}

              </div>
              <div className="contentBlock3">
                Whatever hair extensions you wear, occasionally conditioning
                overnight will be good, making it more shiny and healthy. After
                brushing your hair, apply a suitable amount of hair serum or
                essential oils to the hair strands, avoiding contact with the
                roots and scalp. Then wrap your hair extension with a scarf or
                under your sleeping cap. You will find your hair extension more
                supple, silky, and smooth in the morning.{" "}
